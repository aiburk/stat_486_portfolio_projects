## STAT 486 Portfolio Projects
A repository of two final data analysis portfolio projects I completed for STAT 486 - Introduction to Statistical Computing at Iowa State University in Spring 2024.

The projects were small & closely guided, 
but I am glad to have had the opportunity to develop these tangible portfolios that showcase my statistical computing capabilties.  

## Portfolio 1 - Ethanol
For this assignment I analyzed gas mileage data provided by the professor (__gas_mileage_data.csv__).

__P1-ethanol.html__ contains the full written analysis including tables and figures in an HTML format. 
The HTML file and R Script were created from the Rmarkdown file.

Files:
* __gas_mileage_data.csv__
* __P1-ethanol.html__
* __P1-ethanol.R__
* __P1-ethanol.Rmd__

## Portfolio 2 - Analysis
This assignment was similar to Portfolio 1 except that I had analyzed unique data of my own finding.
I chose to analyze infant birthweight data in the _birthwt_ dataset loaded from the MASS R package.
A written rds file of the dataset (__birthwt.rds__) is included.


__P2-analysis.html__ contains the full written analysis including tables and figures in an HTML format. 
The HTML file and R Script were created from the Rmarkdown file.

Files:
* __birthwt.rds__
* __P2-analysis.html__
* __P2-analysis.R__
* __P2-analysis.Rmd__
