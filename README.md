## STAT 486 Portfolio Projects
A repository of final data analysis portfolio projects I completed for STAT 486 - Introduction to Statistical Computing at Iowa State University in Spring 2024.

The projects were small-scale, 
but I am glad to have had the opportunity to develop these tangible portfolios that showcase my statistical computing capabilties.  

## Portfolio 1 - Ethanol
For this project I analyzed gas mileage data provided by the professor (__gas_mileage_data.csv__).

__P1-ethanol.html__ contains the full written analysis including tables and figures in an HTML format. 
The HTML file and R Script were created from the Rmarkdown file.

Files:
* __gas_mileage_data.csv__
* __P1-ethanol.html__
* __P1-ethanol.R__
* __P1-ethanol.Rmd__

## Portfolio 2 - Analysis
This project was similar to Portfolio 1 except that I had analyzed unique data of my own finding.
I chose to analyze infant birthweight data in the _birthwt_ dataset loaded from the MASS R package.
A written rds file of the dataset (__birthwt.rds__) is included.

__P2-analysis.html__ contains the full written analysis including tables and figures in an HTML format. 
The HTML file and R Script were created from the Rmarkdown file.

Files:
* __birthwt.rds__
* __P2-analysis.html__
* __P2-analysis.R__
* __P2-analysis.Rmd__

## Portfolio 3 - Monte Carlo
For this assignment, I used Monte Carlo simulation to compare the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to point and interval estimation for the binomial model.

__P3-monte_carlo.html__ contains the full written analysis including figures in an HTML format. 
The HTML file and R Script were created from the Rmarkdown file.

Files:
* __monte_carlo_results.rds__
* __P3-monte_carlo.html__
* __P3-monte_carlo.R__
* __P3-monte_carlo.Rmd__
